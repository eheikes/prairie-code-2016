# Treat Your Build Scripts With Some Respect

## Anti-patterns

* Cargo cult Makefiles (blind trust)
* Pass it off to other teams
* Pass it off to expert on the team (siloing)
* "Works on my machine" but not build server
* End of the world when CI goes red
* Watermelons (green on outside, red on inside): succeed, fail, succeed with failures, fail but it's okay

## Demo

* writing unit tests for Rake tasks
