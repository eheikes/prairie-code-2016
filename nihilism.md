# Embracing Nihilism

Fail early

## Dead Code

* Not just unexecuted code
* Unused features

## Story

* Spent 8 months writing requirements -- anything they could think of
* Old code was never cleaned up
* Cutting out code
* Putting it in a book to show CEO

## Nihilism

* Nihilism -- "nothing has a real existence". Nothing really matters.
* Most code won't really be used, or will be gone in 20yrs

## Method

* Simplest solution that might possibly work (KISS)
* Monitor LoC, # of files
* Aim for net negative in LoC

## Misc

* Analytics on how often a feature is used
* Talk to customers
* Get buy-in from / discuss with devs before removing (ego)
* Keep devs engaged in the process
