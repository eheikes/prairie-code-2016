## Old Challenges

* Guilt and work-life balance
* Need tight feedback loop with manager

## New Challenges

* Time zones
* Effective communication over IM (sarcasm, facial expressions)
* Dedicating full attention to mtgs
* Disconnect from culture / team rapport / lack of connection
* Being forgotten

## Tips

* Have a dedicated workspace. Not a recliner or kitchen table. Can close a door. Corner of the house. (compartmentalize)
* Shut down machine at end of day. mental shutdown.
* Turn off email/chat notifications on phone
* Have a structured work schedule (at least when starting).
* Nice office chair. Good internet. (Don't tolerate the small problems.) Office swag.
* Restrict to 40hrs week.
* Look for opportunities to be included. (video calls. stay on the call after business is done to chat.)
* Exercise.
* Have a separate computer for personal use.
* Slack `#random` room
* Random coffee roulette
* Visit in-person occasionally
* Have on-site onboarding

## Tips for Employers

* Remote-friendly vs remote-first
* "If one person is remote, everybody is remote."
* Onboarding structure so they aren't overwhelmed
* Have a mentor to establish rapport
* Deliberately/actively engage to communicate
* Have remote alternatives to local-only perks (food, new chairs, gym memberships, etc)
* Establish & respect "quiet hours" for remote devs.

## Point

* Make your remote workers feel they belong.
* Otherwise just contractors with benefits.
* Define your career goals. (manager track etc)
* Decide how often you'd like to work from the office.
* Research a potential employer.

## Misc

* Dedicated person (liason)?
* Dedicated peer review / collaboration time (for whiteboarding and discussion)
* Hire devs who will be social / communicate
* Refs: hanselman.com, *Remote: Office Not Required* book from 37Signals
* Dressing in "work" clothes helps compartmentalize
* Don't continue discussion after video call (if it's important to include everyone)
* Communicate sales and other general communication about the company
